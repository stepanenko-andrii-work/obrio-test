1) To run the docker container, use the following command: ```docker-compose up --build```
2) To upload the files urls, use the ```/files``` API <b>POST</b> method with the following body: ```{ urls: [<"file_url">] }```, where ```<"file_url">``` is the link to the file. This method downloads all the files locally (temporary) to upload them afterwards to the specified location on Google Drive, as well as creating a File instance in the PostgreSQL database.
3) To get all the files names and urls from the PostgreSQL database, use the ```/files``` API <b>GET</b> method.
